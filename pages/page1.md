Today the Spider felt alone. It seemed nothing surrounded them, except a sea of blankness. The
blankness was disquietingly white and painfully symmetric. It felt as if life could be no stiller.
Suddenly, frighteningly, petrifyingly, the Spider with a crash became trapped: sealed in an imperceivable
cell. Too struck to move, the Spider stared forward with fuzziness at the shiny jagged bends of their glass
prison. Beneath them, the waves of the sea of blankness had begun to wash over and wade along their
eight legs. *Was this a dream?* Just as the Spider began to ponder this, the very Earth beneath them
began to rise into the air quickly and nauseatingly. **No, this must be a nightmare.**
The Spider dug all eight tarsi into the soft shore beneath them and closed all eight eyes, waiting for it to
pass. Then again came another surprise: everything suddenly stopped moving. The glass cage around
them, which, to the Spider, looked just about as blank as everywhere else, became filled with a warm,
soft glow. The Spider found euphoric beauty in the glow, as if it were an embrace from light itself.
Hauntingly, the glass began to vibrate. It would vibrate in determined pulses and murmurs, outlining a
rhythm to match the warmth of the glow. The Spider remembered how it felt to be delighted.
And it was gone. As quickly as it came, the glass cell released the Spider out into a whirling world of wind
and gravity. In a disturbing, familiar crash, the Spider landed back first on the jagged, tiled ground, its
chest splitting apart by the force of the impact. Dead immediately.

Darkness. Ha, the Spider laughed. Darkness was a welcome exchange for blankness. The Spider
remembered fearing darkness, once upon a time, but something told them to receive the darkness’
richness before its refusal of simple visual appeasements. A Professor and their friend had been
discussing darkness and what it contained, the Spider could remember vividly the Professor’s
elaboration of polychromatic darkness:
“It’s dark not because it’s lacking light, it’s dark because it has so many different colors happening all at
once... (Living entities) live in worlds of darkness, but that doesn’t mean they lack activity, it just means
that they’re concealed by something else.”
The Spider felt spoken of in this conversation, even having never met the two humans (until now). The
Spider truthfully preferred the darkness to the light, as they were never able to see very far or very
much. So the Spider took the Professor’s advice and set off to explore the darkness around them. With
each step the Spider took, a cacophonous wrinkling noise was made, yet nevertheless they pressed
onward headed in no direction in particular, as the Professor continued.
“The place that begins at the top of your head, and that opens up to new possibilities.”
